{"name":"Topekacb","tagline":"Support of the Topeka United Way's Christmas Bureau","body":"### Welcome\r\nThis is the collaboration site for support of the Topeka, KS Christmas Bureau. We're glad you're taking a look and wouldn't mind a hand if you've got some skills. \r\n\r\n### History\r\nA group of volunteers from [se2](http://www.se2.com/) joined with [Let's Help](http://letshelpinc.com/) and the [United Way of Greater Topeka](https://www.unitedwaytopeka.org/) to develop better tools for the annual Christmas Bureau campaign. The Christmas Bureau's goal is to make sure that no one in our community goes with out a Christmas by providing a clearing house to \"adopt\" families for a Christmas. This process matches willing givers with families in need of a little (or lot) of help to provide presents, food, etc... to make a Merry Christmas for thousands of folks in the Topeka area. \r\n\r\n### Helping us \r\nEach year, volunteers develop, enhance and host systems used to collect data that matches \"adoptees\" with \"adoptors\". We use cloud hosted SaaS technology to bring this system to life each fall in support of the volunteers that run this amazing program. We can always use skilled developers, analysts, project managers, etc... to make the systems better each year. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
